#string method

the string method i used is called isupper()

isupper(): this method is used to check if a string is in upper case or not

if we want to change the string to uppercase we use upper()


     name = "string methods"
     is_upper = name.isupper() 
     print(is_upper) # it prints the value False
    
     #to change the string to upper case we use :
     print(name.upper())
